# CovPals

CovPals is a website that was created to combat feelings of isolation faced by many individuals in lockdown. We pair people from all backgrounds to have a virtual bonding session! CovPals allows users to meet a new friend online, and schedule meetings between them once a week to catalyze social interaction for anyone who is interested but may not have many people to talk to. The site was made to connect people through the internet and help fight the negative effects of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of the general public. We hope to improve connectivity through the internet with this project!

## How we built it
For the front end, we used React to create our views and forms. For the back end, we used Express, Nodejs, and MongoDB to store and access our database of users.
We utilized the Mailgun API to give our server the ability to automate sending emails to participants, and to notify them of their matches. Additionally, we leveraged the Zoom API to generate weekly meeting links for each matched pair of users.
